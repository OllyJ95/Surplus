          <h1>About Us</h1>

          <p>Surplus is about giving people ability to give back to their local communities and help those less fortunate. The project focuses around crowdfunding meals for people of a low economic standing. The project allows people to donate money for those less fortunate to use exclusively at local restaurants and food outlets.
  
          In order for users to be eligible for the service, they will have to provide multiple forms of identification and their income information. This information is required to ensure the service is being provided to those who need it most, and is kept completely confidential. The user is then issued a credit card which they can use at the participating outlets. Depending on the applicant's economic status, a daily limit will be imposed on them.
          <br>
          <br>
          This service not only allows users to help others in need, but gives them a way to provide to their local community. By ensuring money is spent locally, user donations will help boost their local economy.
          <br>
